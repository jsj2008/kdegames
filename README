Debugging
---------
You can use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull with the cmake command script, if you
want to have debug code in your KDE apps and libs. We recommend to do this, 
since this is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot 
easier.

Additional Games
----------------
There are additional games and game-related applications and libraries that are 
not yet mature enough to be included in the KDE Games module or are being
developed by other teams. Most of them can be found on the KDE playground,
but some are hosted elsewhere, including some game servers.
For a complete list, see the INDEX file in playground/games.
