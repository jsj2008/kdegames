TODO LIST - as at 02 July 2008
------------------------------

Features Ready for KDE 4.1

- Implement "Go To Standard View" from an arbitrary rotation of the whole cube.
- Integrate keyboard moves and move-memory with rotations of the whole cube.
- Implement Singmaster's move notation for keyboard moves (e.g. LRUDFB for
  Left, Right, Up, Down, Front and Back), probably in a text-entry box, to
  allow for combined strings of moves to be entered and executed.
- Implement anti-aliasing, but with minimal performance loss.
- Show a background picture.

Fixed Ready for KDE 4.1

- Sudden jumps during right-button cube-rotation - smoothed out or avoided.
- Toolbar default set to IconsOnly.
- Blinking on keyboard moves - timing fixed.
- Singmaster moves, Singmaster display, Realign Cube, XYZ moves, Undo and Redo
  synchronised correctly.
- Singmaster moves synchronised with GUI actions Save/Load, Quit, etc.
- Set the correct View action button as "checked" when Kubrick starts.

Fixing Bugs and Blemishes

- Icons needed for Kubrick application and the three new View actions.
- Alternate keyboard shortcuts disappeared since KDE 4.0 release. Revive them.
- Implementation of Settings to be made more consistent between demos and play.
- Streamlined left-button slice-move sometimes goes in an unexpected direction.
- Compound Singmaster moves not fully implemented.

Adding New Features

- Remove the status-bar. Put all in-game messages into the OpenGl canvas.
- Add a move-counter.
- Do something special when the cube has been solved.
- Synchronise the Singmaster display with solution moves and pretty patterns.
- Add graphics and color-schem themes for background and cube-faces.
