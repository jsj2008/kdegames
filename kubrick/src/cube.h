/** 
 * The Cube class represents a Rubik's Cube in an abstract way.
 *
 * Actually the "cube" is a rectangular parallelepiped, which can have unequal
 * sides, like a brick, or can be one layer thick, like a mat.  The cube is
 * made up of many "cubies" (small cubes) stacked in a 3-D array.  The original
 * Rubik's Cube was an array of 3x3x3 cubies, but in this version the sides can
 * have any number of cubies between 1 and 6, but only one side can be 1 cubie
 * long, otherwise the puzzle becomes too easy (e.g. the dimensions can be
 * 1x2x2, 6x6x6, 4x1x3, 3x4x5, etc.).
 *
 * The six faces of the cube are covered in stickers of six different colors.  
 * Cubies are dark grey, but can have stickers on one, two or three of their
 * six faces, depending on whether they are located in the middle of a cube
 * face, on a cube edge or at a cube corner.  If all cube dimensions are 3 or
 * more, some cubies will be hidden and will have no stickers (e.g. a 3x3x3
 * cube has one hidden cubie).  To save time when handling large cubes, we do
 * not draw hidden cubies.
 *
 * The cube can be "shuffled" by rotating "slices" of cubies that lie in the
 * same plane, analogous to slices of a loaf of bread.  The faces of the cube
 * then become a jumble of colors.
 *
 * The object of the game is to "solve" a shuffled cube, by selecting and
 * rotating slices in sequence so that all the cube faces end up with their
 * original colors.
 *
 * This class holds the current position of the cube, using an abstract set
 * of co-ordinates that simplify procedures such as creating, painting and
 * moving a cube.  Firstly, all cubies are of size 2x2x2.  This means that
 * the centre of a cubie always has integer co-ordinates, regardless of
 * whether the number of cubies in a side is even or odd.
 *
 * The origin of the co-ordinates is at the centre of gravity of the cube and
 * the centres of the cubies have positive and negative co-ordinates running
 * from there.  Looking at one co-ordinate only of a line of cubies, we have:
 *
 *     Centres of 3 cubies:   |-2 | 0 | +2|   - End faces at -3 and +3
 *
 *     Centres of 4 cubies: |-3 |-1 | +1| +3| - End faces at -4 and +4
 *
 * Note that the origin (zero) is between two cubies when the number of cubies
 * in the line is even.  More importantly, note that the end faces of the line,
 * which will have stickers, are always at -N and +N, where N is the number
 * of cubies in the line.  In a full cube, consisting of LxMxN cubies, the six
 * colored faces are at distances -L, +L, -M, +M, -N and +N from the origin.
 *
 * A slice (see above) is represented as all cubies whose centres have the same
 * value in one of the co-ordinates.  That value also gives the location of the
 * slice and the axis around which to rotate the slice.  For example, in a
 * 3x3x3 cube, the slice containing the right-hand face will consist of all
 * cubies whose centres have X-coordinate = +2 and the axis around which the
 * slice rotates is the X-axis itself, which runs from left to right through
 * the centre of the cube (the origin of co-ordinates).
 *
 * Finally, looking at the screen, the X-axis runs from left to right, the
 * Y-axis runs from bottom to top (as in mathematics) and the Z-axis runs from
 * back to front (out of the screen towards you), which is as in OpenGL library
 * usage.  Last but not least, the co-ordinates of points such as the centre of
 * a cubie are stored in arrays of size 3 (e.g. the X, Y and Z co-ordinates of
 * a point P are in array elements P[0], P[1] and P[3] and the X, Y and Z axes
 * are now the "0", "1" and "2" axes.
 *
 * This is handy because just two numbers, an axis number and a co-ordinate
 * value can represent any slice or face of the cube.  For example the top and
 * bottom faces of a 3x3x3 cube are (1,3) and (1,-3) and the central horizontal
 * slice is (1,0), representing the planes Y = +3 and Y = -3 and the 9 cubies
 * whose centres have Y = 0.
