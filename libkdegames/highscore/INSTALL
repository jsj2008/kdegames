Installation notes for the highscore files ; this is only relevant if you
configured libkdegames with option --enable-highscore-dir=DIR (usually DIR is
/var/games) for using system-wide highscore files.

For each game using the highscore system :

- the game executable "mygame" should be installed sgid "games"

- an empty file "mygame.scores" should be created in the directory pointed by
the configuration option. It should be owned by group "games" with read and
write permissions and should -not- be world readable (since it can contains
possibly sensitive information associating username with game usage).
