some thoughts and comments about the lib - usually for KGame hackers

- setMin/MaxPlayers() etc. use KGameProperty::changeValue() which is slightly
  unclean but as these functions can only called by the ADMIN it doesn't matter.
- AB: KGamePropertyList && KGamePropertyArray:
     for PolicyClean||PolicyDirty the values are streamed into a QDataStream as usual
     for PolicyDirty||PolicyLocal the values are streamed as well but
     additionally command() is called immediately. The values are read from
     the stream there. This is some kind of performance loss as it would be
     faster *not* to stream it but imediately call e.g. insert(). But it will
     probably save a *lot* of bugs!
