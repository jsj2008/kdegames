/**
 * @class KGameRenderedObjectItem kgamerenderedobjectitem.h <KGameRenderedObjectItem>
 * @since 4.6
 * @short A QGraphicsObject which displays pixmaps from a KGameRenderer.
 *
 * This item displays a pixmap which is retrieved from a KGameRenderer, and is
 * updated automatically when the KGameRenderer changes the theme.
 *
 * The item has built-in handling for animated sprites (i.e. those with multiple
 * frames). It is a QGraphicsObject and exposes a "frame" property, so you can
 * easily run the animation by plugging in a QPropertyAnimation.
 *
 * @section operationalmodes Modes of operation
 *
 * By default, this item behaves just like a QGraphicsPixmapItem. The size of
 * its bounding rect is equal to the size of the pixmap, i.e. the renderSize().
 *
 * However, the KGameRenderedObjectItem has a second mode of operation, which is
 * enabled by setting a "primary view". (This can be done automatically via
 * KGameRenderer::setDefaultPrimaryView.)
 *
 * If such a primary view is set, the following happens:
 * \li The renderSize of the pixmap is automatically determined from the
 *     painting requests received from the primary view (manual calls to
 *     setRenderSize() are unnecessary and need to be avoided).
 * \li The size of the item's boundingRect() is independent of the renderSize().
 *     The default fixedSize() is 1x1, which means that the item's bounding rect
 *     is the unit square (moved by the configured offset()).
