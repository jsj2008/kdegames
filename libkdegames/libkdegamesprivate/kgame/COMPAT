06.09.2001:  replace the signal signalCreatePlayer by the virtual function
             createPlayer. It has the same arguments but the return value
             is the new player
06.09.2001:  the KGameConfig dialog changes the parameter initConfigs from bool
             to long. Use the ConfigOptions to specify what options you want
             to have enabled. Default is all
06.09.2001:  some int->quint32 in sender, receiver and player parameters. maybe
             more will follow.
06.09.2001:  KGameIO::signalPrepareMove(..., bool&) ->
             KGameIO::signalPrepareMove(..., bool*): don't know why this was
             necessary but it didn't work anymore...
16.09.2001:  KGamePropertyHandler uses bool* for the sent parameter now. This is
             because QT3 obviously doesn't honor referneces in signals/slots.
             This might even be a QT bug. Bad situation - we use references
             everywhere in KGame... hope nothing else is affecterd by this
             problem (signalPrepareMove was fixed already by me)
18.09.2001:  bool* for Key/Mouseevents and IOAdded in kgameio.h too
19.09.2001:  Kgame:nextPlayer retunrs the KPlayer *nextplayer instead of bool              
19.09.2001:  gameOver() renamed to checkGameOver() !!!!!
18.09.2001:  Question: Should the signal signalPlayerInput(QDataStream &,KPlayer *))
             be made a virtual function? 
             MH: This is done now. As this is a central function your programs will
             not run anymore. Fix: rename your slot which is connected to the above
             signal to playerInput() and return TRUE in it. This will make it 100%
             compatible to the old version. I think this chagne is necessary especially
             as a signal is of no use here as you cannot read twice from the same stream.
             Therefore there can be only one function processing the input. If you really
             need a signal, you can of course simply emit it in the overwritten playerInput
             function
20.09.2001  playerInputFinished(void->KPlayer *)
--------------------- KGAME_ALPHA_1 --------------------- 
06.10.2001  adding KGameNetwork::signalAdminStatusChanged - needed for
            KGameDialog
06.10.2001  KGame::loadGame() doesn't call setPolicy() anymore!
08.10.2001  KGamePropertyList now honor policies! Use setPolicy(PolicyDirty) to
            get the old behavior!
            The behavior of KGamePropertyArray may have changed in this turn,
            too!
            The API stays the same.
11.10.2001  KGameDialogGeneralConfig now doesn't provide setMin/maxPlayers()
            anymore. The game should manage this internally. layout() is
            obsolete as well 
18.10.2001  KPlayer::signalNetworkData contained QDataStream& instead of const
            QByteArray& parameter (oops!). This is fixed now. All apps which
            used this signal must be changed.
18.10.2001  KGame::sendProperty(), KGame::sendPlayerProperty(),
            KPlayer::sendProperty() and related functions contain a "int msgid"
            parameter. This is the id() of the property handler. This parameter
            enables us to easily add any number of property handler to a game
            just by connecting it to existing send slots and call
            processMessage() in slotNetworkData()
03.11.2001  KPlayer::signalNetworkData now emits msgid-KGameMessage::IdUser just
            like KGame::signalNetworkData does
06.11.2001  KGameDialog has some small improvements - easier and IMHO better
            constructor code. Most code should be compatible :-)
